  <h2 data-aos="fade-up">What is a Hard Money Loan?</h2>
  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
    Hard money loans are a type of short-term financing secured by real estate. Unlike traditional loans, which are typically
      offered by banks and credit unions based on the borrower's creditworthiness, hard money loans are based on the value of the property being used as collateral.
      This makes them an attractive option for real estate investors and developers who need quick access to funds for property purchases, renovations, or other investments.
      Hard money loans can be processed much faster than conventional loans, often within a week, allowing borrowers to seize opportunities that require immediate financing.
One of the key advantages of hard money loans is their flexibility. Lenders have more discretion in determining the
      terms of the loan, which can lead to customized solutions for borrowers. However, it’s important to note that these loans often come with higher interest rates compared to traditional financing.
      This is due to the increased risk that lenders assume, as well as the shorter lending periods. Before taking out a hard money loan, it’s essential to carefully consider your financial situation and ensure that you have a clear plan for repayment.
In conclusion, hard money loans can be a valuable resource for those needing quick financing solutions,
      particularly in real estate. However, it’s crucial to approach these loans with careful consideration and a solid repayment plan.

Properties must be non-owner occupied and used strictly for investment purposes. Terms are subject to underwriting review and market conditions.
